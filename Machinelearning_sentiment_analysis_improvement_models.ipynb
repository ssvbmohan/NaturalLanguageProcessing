       "   'review': '😁I just saw the Lion King and I have to say.........\\nI was bored out of my mind. It\\'s rant time:\\n\\n😟Hear me out! The animators were the shit. I have had a peek into the process and know it took a MONSTROUS amount of work to create the characters. You could see the muscles and even the veins!! They did an AMAZING job creating the world and it\\'s animals in this movie.\\n\\n😡However, I\\'ve got a lot of beef with this movie. It was like a delicious looking cake that had no flavor and no ice cream on the side. This is Disney, and I want my side of fucking ice cream.\\n.\\n1) Character design: It looked fantastic and super realistic, but that\\'s the problem right there; It looked SOOOO realistic, that the expressions on the characters were nearly non existent. It is possible to create this kind of realism, but still have enough imaginative unrealistic designs that wont clash. Look at Smaug and how Bennedict played that character; it looked real, and the performance is fucking GREAT. Just go look up the youtube vid of him in the motion capture suit.  Without good BODY LANGUAGE AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, you could easily tell it was just actors standing in front of a mic and not throwing themselves into the role. \\n\\n2) Voice Actors: They were also flat as fuck. I was hyped about the cast, so this was really disappointing. The inflections on the lines just didnt come off of the screen. It sounded like all the animals were shitty high school kids that happened to have nice singing voices do their first Lion King play 1 week after getting the script. I was looking forward to that moment where Scar warns Mufasa not to turn his back on him and suddenly Mufasa has this THREATENING voice saying \"Is that a challenge?!\". That moment came on screen and I was bored (seriously, look at the original). No emotional content. The voice directing was trash.\\n\\n1+2=3) With one and two combined, it\\'s just crap. Emotionless crap. I didnt feel Simba\\'s pain or fear when his father died, and I wanted to. When you have super realistic animals, you dont get facial expressions. Combine that with weak voice inflections and I felt nothing. No pauses or moments where you could feel tension or any sort of movement of emotion.\\n\\n4) Carbon Copy: I KNOW it is a remake, but I feel like they majorly missed an opportunity. They should have dropped every damn song but Hakuna Matata and made more time for character development. I cant believe Scar breaking into song looking like that. \\n\\nWhat do I mean by character development? I LOVE DC\\'s animated movies. Under the Red Hood is fucking dope. However, if you copy that exactly into a live action movie, the characters will likely seem a bit flat. I think when you bring more realism to the screen, you have to care more about your characters. I dont fully know how to explain it. More story to support a character\\'s emotional journey is needed the closer it gets to reality I think. Drop the songs and add more scenes or dialogue along those lines and MAYBE I would have felt it more. \\n\\nThe battle for pride rock mostly sucked. Why copy? You have so much to build on!! What if Scar had a small army of animals that were \"protected\" going up against Simba and his rebels at the end? What if it was closer to a war? Just a thought...\\n\\n5) The story boarding was trash. Too much lifted from the original. If you cant use facial expressions, then you need to pick your shots and place your figures (i forget the term for that) better to make the audience feel certain emotions. \\nOk, there have been worse, but again...with all this technology, your visual storytelling should have been much better. \\n\\nThe movie looks fantastic, but I wanted to walk out. I stayed hoping that the final battle or Childish Gambino would rock it. Nope. The original Lion King movie better. \\n\\nAnyways, rant over. I should have made a youtube vid out of this.',\n",

       "  'review': '😁I just saw the Lion King and I have to say.........\\nI was bored out of my mind. It\\'s rant time:\\n\\n😟Hear me out! The animators were the shit. I have had a peek into the process and know it took a MONSTROUS amount of work to create the characters. You could see the muscles and even the veins!! They did an AMAZING job creating the world and it\\'s animals in this movie.\\n\\n😡However, I\\'ve got a lot of beef with this movie. It was like a delicious looking cake that had no flavor and no ice cream on the side. This is Disney, and I want my side of fucking ice cream.\\n.\\n1) Character design: It looked fantastic and super realistic, but that\\'s the problem right there; It looked SOOOO realistic, that the expressions on the characters were nearly non existent. It is possible to create this kind of realism, but still have enough imaginative unrealistic designs that wont clash. Look at Smaug and how Bennedict played that character; it looked real, and the performance is fucking GREAT. Just go look up the youtube vid of him in the motion capture suit.  Without good BODY LANGUAGE AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, you could easily tell it was just actors standing in front of a mic and not throwing themselves into the role. \\n\\n2) Voice Actors: They were also flat as fuck. I was hyped about the cast, so this was really disappointing. The inflections on the lines just didnt come off of the screen. It sounded like all the animals were shitty high school kids that happened to have nice singing voices do their first Lion King play 1 week after getting the script. I was looking forward to that moment where Scar warns Mufasa not to turn his back on him and suddenly Mufasa has this THREATENING voice saying \"Is that a challenge?!\". That moment came on screen and I was bored (seriously, look at the original). No emotional content. The voice directing was trash.\\n\\n1+2=3) With one and two combined, it\\'s just crap. Emotionless crap. I didnt feel Simba\\'s pain or fear when his father died, and I wanted to. When you have super realistic animals, you dont get facial expressions. Combine that with weak voice inflections and I felt nothing. No pauses or moments where you could feel tension or any sort of movement of emotion.\\n\\n4) Carbon Copy: I KNOW it is a remake, but I feel like they majorly missed an opportunity. They should have dropped every damn song but Hakuna Matata and made more time for character development. I cant believe Scar breaking into song looking like that. \\n\\nWhat do I mean by character development? I LOVE DC\\'s animated movies. Under the Red Hood is fucking dope. However, if you copy that exactly into a live action movie, the characters will likely seem a bit flat. I think when you bring more realism to the screen, you have to care more about your characters. I dont fully know how to explain it. More story to support a character\\'s emotional journey is needed the closer it gets to reality I think. Drop the songs and add more scenes or dialogue along those lines and MAYBE I would have felt it more. \\n\\nThe battle for pride rock mostly sucked. Why copy? You have so much to build on!! What if Scar had a small army of animals that were \"protected\" going up against Simba and his rebels at the end? What if it was closer to a war? Just a thought...\\n\\n5) The story boarding was trash. Too much lifted from the original. If you cant use facial expressions, then you need to pick your shots and place your figures (i forget the term for that) better to make the audience feel certain emotions. \\nOk, there have been worse, but again...with all this technology, your visual storytelling should have been much better. \\n\\nThe movie looks fantastic, but I wanted to walk out. I stayed hoping that the final battle or Childish Gambino would rock it. Nope. The original Lion King movie better. \\n\\nAnyways, rant over. I should have made a youtube vid out of this.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This movie was visually gorgeous as one would expect but in the end it just felt rushed. From the opening sequence it felt shorter and less grandiose than the original. The voice actors did a good job but not great. The originals did a much better job of selling their personalities as animals where this version failed to suspend the disbelief. Many of the moments felt like a person singing the songs rather than the actual characters. It also seemed like they changed each song slightly to fit the voice actors strengths rather than casting someone that could pull off the original ensembles. Overall it was a good watch because it was just visually breathtaking, but as whole this really falls flat considering the high hopes and expectations set for such a classic and nostalgic movie.

Due to the animals realism they lack facial expressions majorly taking you out of the story and making comedic moments fall flat. The voice casting was ok, though I found at some points Beyonce's voice lacked emotion at the most important times. And the most disappointing for me was all the covers of the original songs. \\n\\nTo sum it up: worth a watch for visuals and that's about it.\",\n",

But this movie? Meh. What on earth was the point of it? Sure, it's visually stunning, no doubt about that. But is this a movie, or 110 minutes of what we can do with animation these days? Besides the fact that this was pretty much shot-for-shot the exact same film we all know, it wasn't even that good. How this film could boast such an amazing cast and yet seem so incredibly badly cast is a total mystery. I can't put my finger on what it is about this movie that makes it miss the mark on comedy, on heart, and on wonder, but it does. I was mildly entertained, but nothing more. \",\n",

       "  'review': \"This movie was not great.  It was not even okay.  It was a complete and utter cash grab of a film.  My girlfriend and I left shortly after the gorge scene because we could not stand this film.  \\n\\nMy single most significant criticism for the film is that all of the acting that we saw up to that point felt utterly phoned in from the start of the film.  Even Jame Earl Jones, who I love sounded like he was cold reading lines.  Every single actor felt like they were reading lines on a page with total indifference.  There was no sense of urgency or any emotion at all with the characters.\\n\\nThe significant scenes leading up to the gorge scene felt eviscerated of meaning due to this fact — scenes like when Mufasa is scolding Simba after saving them from the hyenas.  Mufasa did not have emotion in his voice at all.  Worse yet during the gorge scene Scar saying his famous line, and Mufasa falling to his death, again wholly flat. \\n\\nUpon walking out on the film, we immediately went and picked up a copy of the original movie and noticed a very significant difference, especially with James Earl Jones' Mufasa.  Every character felt alive and emotionally grounding, whereas the CGI film just felt flat and did not try to immerse you.\\n \\nThe film felt like a cash grab with big list actors to try and draw in crowds who were excited based on their memories from the original.  I was one of them.  Immediately from the start, this film felt off and continued to get worse as it progressed.  I have never in my life felt compelled to leave a theater until seeing this film.   \",\n",

It was great! When Disney tried to copy themselves, it was not so good. The only thing more unoriginal than Walt Disney these days is...nothing. They have zero originality today. They should call Tezuka's grandson and ask for some ideas. \",\n",

I sang a long and as I watched the movie I envisioned the original in its place. It felt more like a sing-a-long and feel good experience because of the music than any other experience that this film was new, just recycled into a visually boring film.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The Lion King is a 2019 live-action remake of 1994\\'s animated movie of the same name.\\nIt is directed by Jon Favreau, who previously directed Disney\\'s The Jungle Book. It uses\\nthe photorealistic computer-animation technique to create animals. The 1994\\'s version is\\none of the best movies of all time. So does this movie lives up to all hype? Definitely.\\nAll animals look so realistic that you can\\'t differentiate between them and those in\\nNational Geographic\\'s documentary. It is visually stunning. But at the same time, this is\\none of the limitations of the movie too. Since all animals look real, it limits the ability to\\nshow expression like in animation one can show shocking expression by very big eyes,\\nwhich will look little awkward if they try that in live-action. The movie keeps zoological\\nauthenticity.\\nIt would be a little injustice to the movie if we compare it with 1994\\'s version as\\nchildhood memories are always sweeter and this is the reason the older one will always\\nbe better than the later one.\\nAs an individual, I really enjoyed the movie. The lovely Father-Son relation, their\\nbonding, Mufasa\\'s philosophy and lessons to Simba are still very effective. One can\\neasily connect with them. When Simba puts his paw on the impression of his Father\\'s\\npaw, the scene is literally heart touching.\\nSeth Rogen and Billy Eichner are delightful as Pumbaa and his best friend Timon. Both\\ncharacters entertain people a lot. They teach Simba a new philosophy \"Hakuna Matata\"\\nwhich was opposite of Mufasa\\'s Philosophy.\\nThere is a lot to learn from The Lion King. The movie teaches so many lessons of life and\\nperfectly depicts human nature with the help of animals.',\n",

Most of the musical scores were true to the original, but they ruined \"Be Prepared\". All in all I would still recommend the original over the remake, as animation is a medium that ages well anyway',\n",

       "  'review': \"I don't think the fact that it's almost exactly like the original is an issue. That's what should be expected. The problem is that they *didn't* recreate the original scenes to properly represent the original. I feel like they could have easily included more emotion and time for important scenes (which is what the audience is specifically interested in for nostalgia). The movie simply feels rushed. It seems like, because the main focus of this film was for the CGI to be breathtaking, that there wasn't enough attention to other important factors when it comes to creating movies. Timing, improvisation, and being more careful with details doesn't seem to have been on their minds. l did enjoy this movie, but when it's clear that so much could have easily been corrected to make the film better, it's disappointing. \",\n",

Now if you're 3 years old, you don't notice things like this, but the Industry has to get a clue that when you remake a CLASSIC, you at least have to make it as good or better....they left out funny scenes and changed the dialogue which didn't enhance the scenes. Also, the theater sound was horrible, the voices were to the left, the music to the right, the WHOLE experience was just totally disappointing. Disney is not doing very good quality control and it shows. The CGI was amazing, but you didn't have the right voices for the characters, especially SCAR, it was just terrible. It also proves one thing, CGI is just a part of the whole, you can't make it on CGI alone.\",\n",

But there were obvious places where the CGI didn't align with the movements physics-wise (mostly gravity issues), and sound-wise when it came to the mouth movements. I know for a fact that they aren't aren't using their full capabilities yet, especially with AI technology at their disposal, and I bet this was a gold mine at the box office. The only reason I brought this up is because - how in the world are you going to make a live-action film that's most obviously not live-action? Stop grabbing people's money with cheap tricks. Get CGI to where I can't tell a difference at all before you start calling CGI films, live-action films. Duh. \\n\\nEverything else was pretty much regular Lion King, although I really did enjoy some of the human-like expressive behavior coming from mostly Zazu. The bird's natural fast-twitch muscle behavior along with the expressive voice and synced-up beak, really did sort of make me think there was some sort of talking bird in the midst of us.\",\n",

The original was my son's very first movie at a theater and had to be our favorite movie when he was little. And then we had it on VHS and watched it a million times. And then we had it on DVD and watched it a million more times. We know every word. The original was one of the best Disney movies ever, in my opinion. So, when we heard about the remake 25 years later we were excited and went to see it together again. The effects are nice, but they're not, because the characters lacked the heart and emotion and humor of the first film. It just wasn't the same at all. And Scar's character was completely different. You know, some movies just shouldn't be remade. Thumbs sadly down... way down. :(  \",\n",

       "  'review': 'This movie is good but not amazing because it is a shot for shot remake of the 1994 one but somehow did better than the original  and is at the time of the review the 9th highest grossing movie of cinema history although not deserving it the. The scenes that the movie does change are weird and makes me question why like instead of Simba accidentally  sending some dust to Rafiki through wind. NOW Simbas hair lands on a leaf  and is eaten by a Giraffe and then it poops it out and a dung beetle rolls it to Rafiki and it breaks , but why was Rafiki looking at poop . Do you remember that scene where Rafiki  hits Simba on his heas and says that it doesnt matter because it is in the past that is GONE all GONE , but why it was the a moral of the story . Jon favreau   has made alot better the jungle book ( 2016 ) Iron Man and more this is easily the worst movie from him yet this guy helped make ENDGAME ...  ENDGAME  the actors who I will address are Beyonce and Seth Rogen . It felt like beyonce did not try at all but thrived in the scenes where she sang but it is the opposite for Seth Rogen he was an amazing actor but not a good singer . the last thing I will say is the jokes were funny especially the thats local were is it from right there joke .It was flawed but undeserving of the criticisms it is getting I would recommend  it best to watch with family .

This was my favorite animated film in the 90s and I watched it almost every single day of my childhood, so watching it come to life was simply magical. I guess some people were not pleased that it is almost exactly like the original, but that's what I loved about it. It made me nostalgic and so, so happy. The imagery throughout was so beautiful as well. My only real critique is that I thought a few of the voices didn't seem like the right fit, like Nala's, which didn't sound at all like the soft, sweet original voice, for example, and a couple of others. I also felt like some scenes were rushed or over too fast, but overall, this movie is a win for me. Love this movie now and forever.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'HORRIBLE. I knew I didn’t keep procrastinating watching this movie 4 times for nothing. It took for me to get tipsy to finally watch it. The cinematics was the ONLY positive thing about this movie. The mouth movements of the animals were nowhere near matching what they were saying, which is a major key in my opinion, that counted for about 80% of what made the movie bad to me. The second reason I hated it was because it was too National Geographic looking. It was like watching an entire discovery channel movie in the theater, and that wasn’t a good thing for me because I HATE the discovery channel! They should have left this one alone. I didn’t really like the Alladin movie that much but it was definitely way better than this crap. Lion King my butt, skip this crap and go see Good Boys, the best movie out in theaters right now',\n",

       "  'review': 'The original Lion King remains one of my favorite Disney movies. They did an incredible job mirroring the movie, visually--almost shot-by-shot. Animation was beautiful. But my kids were so bored! It was almost like watching a National Geographic movie. And they made the wrong decision in keeping the eyes COMPLETELY expressionless. It lost all heart. Originally emotional scenes were flat. Timon and Pumbaa redeemed some of the heart (despite Seth Rogen being COMPLETELY tone deaf). I was very disappointed.',\n",

Otherwise it was apparently an attempt to get the worst voice actors for every part (other than Mufasa which was still voiced by James Earl Jones and was as amazing as ever). Otherwise, the voice acting was abysmal. Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) was just plain terrible. The voice actor for Timon (Billy Eichner) was apparently required to have the most over the top gay affectation possible (although one of the best singers). And Nala (Beyonce) sounded so ghetto it was distracting. Watch the animated version which is vastly better. Sad since Disney did such a fantastic job with the Aladdin live action remake.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Overall and OK film. Technically well-executed, but creatively uninspired. Pretty much a scene-by-scene replica of the original, which makes it palatable for all ages because the original was good, but also feels uninspired and \"cheap.\" The best I can describe it is like watching a production of a Shakespeare play that you\\'ve read/seen so many times, but this time with different actors, costumes and sets pieces. It\\'s fun to watch just for the nostalgia appeal. The voice acting was well-done all around except for Beyonce who sounded like...well Beyonce reading a script. Parts of the script felt out-dated, out of touch or cheesy, for instance, there was a lot of cringey, campy \"Come-ons!\" and \"Let\\'s do this!\" lines from the child actors. In one scene Beyonce\\'s character literally yells \"Lions, Attack!\"  Meanwhile, they threw in a few twists on certain scenes and transitions but they are so small you might not notice. The most annoying part of the movie was one of these scenes in which they replace the original score with the most random Beyonce song, who was singing as Beyonce and not as her character Nala. It felt so wrong, out of place and obnoxious. All in all worth an end of summer family trip to the movie, but otherwise, you won\\'t miss much by waiting for the DVD/BluRay.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The new Lion King remake is phenomenal!! I personally LOVED the new Lion King. I actually like it just as much as the original if not more. I think Jon Favreau is a creative genius in his visionary take on projects. Unfortunately Disney got the Lion King right the first time, which didn’t necessitate a remake. Which is why 90% of the original had been untouched for the 2019 version. HOWEVER... I think Favreau’s brilliance will really come through if they get him to make a Lion King 2. The original is impossible to beat. But the sequels and spinoffs are much less memorable for MOST fans, yet still provide an excellent foundation for someone like Favreau to take it and really make it something special. Just like he did with Jungle Book. Jungle Book had plenty of room for creative reimagining because it’s not as widely memorable, which is where he could take liberties that he simply didn’t have with Lion King. I honestly think that the remake we got is by far the best possible job any director could’ve done with the scope of the task at hand.

Hyenas are generally tan or grey. Not black. You could blame it on the lighting but the hyena was black.\\n\\nIn fact, it appears that the mean hyena was crafted to emulate a black person. Furthermore, its voice over sounded like a black man. \\n\\nOf course the little children in the audience had no clue they were being brainwashed.\\n\\nLion King storyline attempted the proverbial Joseph Campbell mono-myth dramatic curve.  They even had the cleansing rain at the end but it was no help to improve the  distasteful bathroom humor.\\nLion King failed to sustain the tit-for-tat excitement of Disney yesteryears movies. \\n\\nA shameless, shamefull racial movie.',\n",

       "  'review': \"The Lion King is a 2019 remake of the 1994 Disney classic The Lion King. The film was directed by Jon Favreau, and stars Donald Glover as Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar.\\n\\nThe film in my opinion is a disgrace to the original film, from the emotionless character expressions to the dreadful and unfitting voice acting.\\n\\nThe story was basically the same as the original (nearly down to the beat), but for some reason it felt a lot less epic and not nearly as intriguing or emotional.\\n\\nThe voice acting I found to be stale and dry, from the lack of care in the actors voices to the bland and weary line delivery; one voice actor in particular was Shahadi Wright Joseph as (child) Simba, I found that the performance he gave was really lacking in key areas like emotion and timing.\\n\\nThe characters were basically just the same as the original, so I don't really have much to say here.\\n\\nThe animation may be extremely realistic and detailed, but what angers me most is that because of the realism the animals and characters couldn't express as much emotion as they did in the original film.\\n\\nThe colour scheme was also very dark and grey, which in my opinion takes away from the atmosphere and scale of the film.\\n\\nThe soundtrack was also a huge let down from the original film, from Beyoncé and Donald Glover's version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight (which takes place in the day) to the addition of Beyoncé's song Spirit.\\n\\nThe emotion and relationships in the film were also a lot less gripping, especially the relationship between Simba and Mufasa.\\n\\nThe film I also found to be really bland and uninteresting, but what makes it worse is that the original film was really interesting and had a very strong style to it.\\n\\nOver all I give it a \\n1/10 - would never recommend\\n\\nA shallow and heartless product which should have never been made.\",\n",

I think some of the voice acting was off and the casting couldve been a bit better for at least two characters, but thats most likely just my bias towards the original cinematic film. I also realized they did this for the live action purpose, but I disliked the removal of some iconic scenes and actions from specific characters. Some parts from the 1st movie really added depth to characters and helped the audience really laugh or feel the intensity of a characters thoughts, ideas, plans. Again I know they removed a chunk of these things for live action purposes to fit in with realistic actions, but its hard not to mention either. All in all it was a good reminder of how original The Lion King was back in the day and shows us things that couldve been done differently in some aspects.',\n",

A lot of the voice acting felt like I was watching a community theatre play, which is sad because I really like a lot of the voice actors in this movie. While the animation is great and looks realistic, I think it takes away from the performance because the animals aren't allowed to show much emotion. The story in this one felt very rushed and they added some pretty pointless scenes. It feels very lacking and doesn't have near as much heart as the original.\",\n",

I think the cgi is very impressive, but so many parts has been dropped down from the original - especially the personality of characters.  Some new scene like the journey of Simba's fur is totally ridiculous. \",\n",

       "  'review': \"My teenage son and I went to see it today and we both thought it was amazing. He wasn't even close to being born when the original came out, but of course he's seen it dozens of times. Now he's a gamer and video maker/editor. He warned me as we were walking in that he might be overly critical but we had both agreed we needed to see it in the theaters before it was gone. Even though we both knew the storyline backwards and forwards we were totally sucked in from beginning to end. There were times that I personally felt anxious, like I didn't know what was going to happen. I'm glad we didn't bring his little sister (7 years-old, but very sensitive) as she would have been scared during several parts. My son and I had both heard not-so-great reviews, so we were on the lookout for negatives but neither of us walked away with any negatives to talk about. The animals and scenery were amazing, the action scenes were engaging, the original humor was there with some added bits. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen.\",\n",

If you got kids you want to introduce Disney films to, the classics are still where to go to.  I will say that this is a better outing than most of what we've gotten so far, mostly because the movie is so alike to the original.  I think the best improvement though is the hyenas are given more of a menacing role than the joke that they were in the original.  On the minus column I think the CGI of the lions faces was subpar, really didn't feel any emotion there.  Zazu as well... hard to watch the way that bird was made, a bit freaky. \",\n",

Also thought Seth Rogen as Pumba was a good call. As it is nearly a shot for shot remake it does end up feeling a bit hollow at times and doesn't pack the punch of the original probably because I've seen it all before and was prepared for the emotional scenes. A good movie but if you've seen the original you can pass on it. \",\n",

With them restricted to hyper realism, there was a distinct lack of emotional connection, so Simba looking terrified, sad or overjoyed all looked the same, and often took me out of the moment. Some of the songs also had to be heavily restrained due to hyper-realistic restrictions, such as Scars \"Be Prepared\" song. There were some alterations from the original which were understandable but kind of took the magic out of the film for me.\\n\\nThe effects were superb but wasn\\'t enough to cover the faults of the film for me.',\n",

       "  'review': \"Although it was computer generated and the concern seemed to be that the animals would not reflect the emotions like the original I found that not to be the case. Maybe because lions are my favorite big ct, or the music and singing added a dimension that overshadowed that flaw, but I loved the movie. The scenery was lush and beautiful for the most part, I found the main characters heartwarming, and the interplay between Simba and his father both loving and stern when he explained the dangers when he disobeyed him were convincing for me.  Of course the comic moments were truly scene stealing. I washappen to hear James Earl Jones as Mufasah and there were mystic qualities with Rafeki, The death of Mufasah was was much more dramatic and darker than the original which I naturally expected and I will admit it, I cried!!! I really enjoyed it and was happy I didn't listen to critics and saw it for myself! I am glad they just rehash the story, but change little things here and there in the approach to the story line which made it fresh. Definitely a Must See!!!!\",\n",

       "  'review': \"okay, first of all, I would like to say somethings that need to be said about the critics that aren't giving it fair reviews.\\nFirst, the reason why games like call of duty and FIFA get high reviews are that a lot of critics are not allowed to make a direct compare to others in a series you can make small parts saying like the characters cannot show emotion like the cartoon but you cannot flat out say the first film better therefor this film was bad.\\nnow on to my review \\n_________________________________________________\\ndue to them trying to be realistic it did affect some parts of the movie mostly singing and showing emotion what I mean by this is the singing isn't as clean as you would think the characters sound more like Les Mis where they are more talking through the music and more noise from background fx I don't think many people would like to hear big splash sounds after every step in a song if they are in water oddly it didn't happen in every song just a few \\nnow with how the characters show emotion oddly, they didn't do a bad job I would say but  some characters have the blank face though the whole movie. They manage to get the lions and hyenas to show a lot more than others.\\nShouldn't really need to talk about the story not much change in it \\nI would say this movie wasn't the greatest but there wasn't anything bad in it it was a lot more in the middle for me. It isn't a second watch  for me anytime soon but enjoyable I would say  \\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Overall it\\'s a good film, but there\\'s certainly an uncanny valley feeling compared to the original animation which just sucks you in.  The cinematography is beautiful, the graphics are life-like, but some of the voice acting felt weak.  Donald Glover was great, James Earl Jones is great as we can expect, but I felt Ejiofor, while an incredible actor I\\'ve loved in other flicks, didn\\'t have the level of menace Scar held in the original.  This being said, I think the change to Be Prepared, being made like a pre-battle speech for war was genius and Ejiofor NAILS that particular part.  The additional characters for Simba\\'s time growing up with Timon and Pumba felt unnecessary, and some of the changes to Rafiki\\'s part before Simba sees \"who he is\" felt less engaging than the animated original - but honestly all of this is nit-picking.  I enjoy the film and it felt worth the price of admission.',\n",

I'm not sure whether it was just me, but i felt that some of the voice acting was a little stale, having little emotion behind its performance.  Additionally the CGI made for fantastic models of animals but failed in giving them facial expressions.  This seemed to make the events of the film (which we're all familiar with) feel like they had less of an impact on the characters.  Overall it was still true to the lion king original in its writing and direction, but felt a little uninspired.  Having said that i'm aware that I am probably in the minority as many friends and a family enjoyed it very much.\",\n",

       "  'review': '😁I just saw the Lion King and I have to say.........\\nI was bored out of my mind. It\\'s rant time:\\n\\n😟Hear me out! The animators were the shit. I have had a peek into the process and know it took a MONSTROUS amount of work to create the characters. You could see the muscles and even the veins!! They did an AMAZING job creating the world and it\\'s animals in this movie.\\n\\n😡However, I\\'ve got a lot of beef with this movie. It was like a delicious looking cake that had no flavor and no ice cream on the side. This is Disney, and I want my side of fucking ice cream.\\n.\\n1) Character design: It looked fantastic and super realistic, but that\\'s the problem right there; It looked SOOOO realistic, that the expressions on the characters were nearly non existent. It is possible to create this kind of realism, but still have enough imaginative unrealistic designs that wont clash. Look at Smaug and how Bennedict played that character; it looked real, and the performance is fucking GREAT. Just go look up the youtube vid of him in the motion capture suit.  Without good BODY LANGUAGE AND FACIAL EXPRESSIONS, you could easily tell it was just actors standing in front of a mic and not throwing themselves into the role. \\n\\n2) Voice Actors: They were also flat as fuck. I was hyped about the cast, so this was really disappointing. The inflections on the lines just didnt come off of the screen. It sounded like all the animals were shitty high school kids that happened to have nice singing voices do their first Lion King play 1 week after getting the script. I was looking forward to that moment where Scar warns Mufasa not to turn his back on him and suddenly Mufasa has this THREATENING voice saying \"Is that a challenge?!\". That moment came on screen and I was bored (seriously, look at the original). No emotional content. The voice directing was trash.\\n\\n1+2=3) With one and two combined, it\\'s just crap. Emotionless crap. I didnt feel Simba\\'s pain or fear when his father died, and I wanted to. When you have super realistic animals, you dont get facial expressions. Combine that with weak voice inflections and I felt nothing. No pauses or moments where you could feel tension or any sort of movement of emotion.\\n\\n4) Carbon Copy: I KNOW it is a remake, but I feel like they majorly missed an opportunity. They should have dropped every damn song but Hakuna Matata and made more time for character development. I cant believe Scar breaking into song looking like that. \\n\\nWhat do I mean by character development? I LOVE DC\\'s animated movies. Under the Red Hood is fucking dope. However, if you copy that exactly into a live action movie, the characters will likely seem a bit flat. I think when you bring more realism to the screen, you have to care more about your characters. I dont fully know how to explain it. More story to support a character\\'s emotional journey is needed the closer it gets to reality I think. Drop the songs and add more scenes or dialogue along those lines and MAYBE I would have felt it more. \\n\\nThe battle for pride rock mostly sucked. Why copy? You have so much to build on!! What if Scar had a small army of animals that were \"protected\" going up against Simba and his rebels at the end? What if it was closer to a war? Just a thought...\\n\\n5) The story boarding was trash. Too much lifted from the original. If you cant use facial expressions, then you need to pick your shots and place your figures (i forget the term for that) better to make the audience feel certain emotions. \\nOk, there have been worse, but again...with all this technology, your visual storytelling should have been much better. \\n\\nThe movie looks fantastic, but I wanted to walk out. I stayed hoping that the final battle or Childish Gambino would rock it. Nope. The original Lion King movie better. \\n\\nAnyways, rant over. I should have made a youtube vid out of this.',\n",

       "  'review': 'This movie was visually gorgeous as one would expect but in the end it just felt rushed. From the opening sequence it felt shorter and less grandiose than the original. The voice actors did a good job but not great. The originals did a much better job of selling their personalities as animals where this version failed to suspend the disbelief. Many of the moments felt like a person singing the songs rather than the actual characters. It also seemed like they changed each song slightly to fit the voice actors strengths rather than casting someone that could pull off the original ensembles. Overall it was a good watch because it was just visually breathtaking, but as whole this really falls flat considering the high hopes and expectations set for such a classic and nostalgic movie.

Due to the animals realism they lack facial expressions majorly taking you out of the story and making comedic moments fall flat. The voice casting was ok, though I found at some points Beyonce's voice lacked emotion at the most important times. And the most disappointing for me was all the covers of the original songs. \\n\\nTo sum it up: worth a watch for visuals and that's about it.\",\n",

I also am annoyed with all of these remakes, but let me tell you, this movie was exceptional. The casting was brilliant, Seth Rogan and Billy Eichner as Pumbaa and Timon, absolutely stole the show. That being said, this movie is definitely not as appropriate for a younger crowd like the original cartoon. The CGI is the most realistic that Ive ever seen, and the drama and emotion is unreal. 10/10 go see it, but maybe leave your 4-year-old at home!',\n",

But this movie? Meh. What on earth was the point of it? Sure, it's visually stunning, no doubt about that. But is this a movie, or 110 minutes of what we can do with animation these days? Besides the fact that this was pretty much shot-for-shot the exact same film we all know, it wasn't even that good. How this film could boast such an amazing cast and yet seem so incredibly badly cast is a total mystery. I can't put my finger on what it is about this movie that makes it miss the mark on comedy, on heart, and on wonder, but it does. I was mildly entertained, but nothing more. \",\n",

       "  'review': \"This movie was not great.  It was not even okay.  It was a complete and utter cash grab of a film.  My girlfriend and I left shortly after the gorge scene because we could not stand this film.  \\n\\nMy single most significant criticism for the film is that all of the acting that we saw up to that point felt utterly phoned in from the start of the film.  Even Jame Earl Jones, who I love sounded like he was cold reading lines.  Every single actor felt like they were reading lines on a page with total indifference.  There was no sense of urgency or any emotion at all with the characters.\\n\\nThe significant scenes leading up to the gorge scene felt eviscerated of meaning due to this fact — scenes like when Mufasa is scolding Simba after saving them from the hyenas.  Mufasa did not have emotion in his voice at all.  Worse yet during the gorge scene Scar saying his famous line, and Mufasa falling to his death, again wholly flat. \\n\\nUpon walking out on the film, we immediately went and picked up a copy of the original movie and noticed a very significant difference, especially with James Earl Jones' Mufasa.  Every character felt alive and emotionally grounding, whereas the CGI film just felt flat and did not try to immerse you.\\n \\nThe film felt like a cash grab with big list actors to try and draw in crowds who were excited based on their memories from the original.  I was one of them.  Immediately from the start, this film felt off and continued to get worse as it progressed.  I have never in my life felt compelled to leave a theater until seeing this film.   \",\n",

Scar, Mufasa, Rafeeke, PUMBA, Zazu and Timone were PERFECT and added so much to the  characters! \\nlately,  It was a big disappointment to not have Elton Johns music throughout,  Not that the new versions aren't nice but that its just not the same without Elton.\\nReally nice family movie.\",\n",

Yes, I get a bit of nostalgia running through my brain when I hear the words and yet see a different image that was so iconic it's wrong to mess with.

I sang a long and as I watched the movie I envisioned the original in its place. It felt more like a sing-a-long and feel good experience because of the music than any other experience that this film was new, just recycled into a visually boring film.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'The Lion King is a 2019 live-action remake of 1994\\'s animated movie of the same name.\\nIt is directed by Jon Favreau, who previously directed Disney\\'s The Jungle Book. It uses\\nthe photorealistic computer-animation technique to create animals. The 1994\\'s version is\\none of the best movies of all time. So does this movie lives up to all hype? Definitely.\\nAll animals look so realistic that you can\\'t differentiate between them and those in\\nNational Geographic\\'s documentary. It is visually stunning. But at the same time, this is\\none of the limitations of the movie too. Since all animals look real, it limits the ability to\\nshow expression like in animation one can show shocking expression by very big eyes,\\nwhich will look little awkward if they try that in live-action. The movie keeps zoological\\nauthenticity.\\nIt would be a little injustice to the movie if we compare it with 1994\\'s version as\\nchildhood memories are always sweeter and this is the reason the older one will always\\nbe better than the later one.\\nAs an individual, I really enjoyed the movie. The lovely Father-Son relation, their\\nbonding, Mufasa\\'s philosophy and lessons to Simba are still very effective. One can\\neasily connect with them. When Simba puts his paw on the impression of his Father\\'s\\npaw, the scene is literally heart touching.\\nSeth Rogen and Billy Eichner are delightful as Pumbaa and his best friend Timon. Both\\ncharacters entertain people a lot. They teach Simba a new philosophy \"Hakuna Matata\"\\nwhich was opposite of Mufasa\\'s Philosophy.\\nThere is a lot to learn from The Lion King. The movie teaches so many lessons of life and\\nperfectly depicts human nature with the help of animals.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The voice acting in the original one was more tonal and dramatic, and in my opinion, better. This version seems to have cut out a lot of dialogue in favor of more exposition so that the plot and character motives become much more obvious.The only time where I felt like this was an improvement was the first scenes showing the changes to the pride lands. Most of the musical scores were true to the original, but they ruined \"Be Prepared\". All in all I would still recommend the original over the remake, as animation is a medium that ages well anyway',\n",

The problem is that they *didn't* recreate the original scenes to properly represent the original. I feel like they could have easily included more emotion and time for important scenes (which is what the audience is specifically interested in for nostalgia). The movie simply feels rushed. It seems like, because the main focus of this film was for the CGI to be breathtaking, that there wasn't enough attention to other important factors when it comes to creating movies. Timing, improvisation, and being more careful with details doesn't seem to have been on their minds. l did enjoy this movie, but when it's clear that so much could have easily been corrected to make the film better, it's disappointing. \",\n",

       "  'review': \"To no one's surprise it had the same story as the original Lion King. An updated cast and vocal talent still did not do it justice. Timon (Billy Eichner) and Pumbaa (Seth Rogen) stole the show with their comedic performance. The voice recordings seemed a bit off throughout the movie. Almost as if all voices, songs, and acting were done from in separate studios and mashed together. I was entertained, however not worth seeing in theaters. \\nThanks for reading  :)\",\n",

Also, the theater sound was horrible, the voices were to the left, the music to the right, the WHOLE experience was just totally disappointing. Disney is not doing very good quality control and it shows. The CGI was amazing, but you didn't have the right voices for the characters, especially SCAR, it was just terrible.

But there were obvious places where the CGI didn't align with the movements physics-wise (mostly gravity issues), and sound-wise when it came to the mouth movements. I know for a fact that they aren't aren't using their full capabilities yet, especially with AI technology at their disposal, and I bet this was a gold mine at the box office. The only reason I brought this up is because - how in the world are you going to make a live-action film that's most obviously not live-action? Stop grabbing people's money with cheap tricks. Get CGI to where I can't tell a difference at all before you start calling CGI films, live-action films. Duh. \\n\\nEverything else was pretty much regular Lion King, although I really did enjoy some of the human-like expressive behavior coming from mostly Zazu.

The original was my son's very first movie at a theater and had to be our favorite movie when he was little. And then we had it on VHS and watched it a million times. And then we had it on DVD and watched it a million more times. We know every word. The original was one of the best Disney movies ever, in my opinion. So, when we heard about the remake 25 years later we were excited and went to see it together again. The effects are nice, but they're not, because the characters lacked the heart and emotion and humor of the first film. It just wasn't the same at all. And Scar's character was completely different. You know, some movies just shouldn't be remade. Thumbs sadly down... way down. :(  \",\n",

       "  'review': 'This movie is good but not amazing because it is a shot for shot remake of the 1994 one but somehow did better than the original  and is at the time of the review the 9th highest grossing movie of cinema history although not deserving it the. The scenes that the movie does change are weird and makes me question why like instead of Simba accidentally  sending some dust to Rafiki through wind. NOW Simbas hair lands on a leaf  and is eaten by a Giraffe and then it poops it out and a dung beetle rolls it to Rafiki and it breaks , but why was Rafiki looking at poop . Do you remember that scene where Rafiki  hits Simba on his heas and says that it doesnt matter because it is in the past that is GONE all GONE , but why it was the a moral of the story . Jon favreau   has made alot better the jungle book ( 2016 ) Iron Man and more this is easily the worst movie from him yet this guy helped make ENDGAME ...  ENDGAME  the actors who I will address are Beyonce and Seth Rogen . It felt like beyonce did not try at all but thrived in the scenes where she sang but it is the opposite for Seth Rogen he was an amazing actor but not a good singer . the last thing I will say is the jokes were funny especially the thats local were is it from right there joke .It was flawed but undeserving of the criticisms it is getting I would recommend  it best to watch with family .

This was my favorite animated film in the 90s and I watched it almost every single day of my childhood, so watching it come to life was simply magical. I guess some people were not pleased that it is almost exactly like the original, but that's what I loved about it. It made me nostalgic and so, so happy. The imagery throughout was so beautiful as well. My only real critique is that I thought a few of the voices didn't seem like the right fit, like Nala's, which didn't sound at all like the soft, sweet original voice, for example, and a couple of others. I also felt like some scenes were rushed or over too fast, but overall, this movie is a win for me. Love this movie now and forever.\",\n",

       "  'review': 'HORRIBLE. I knew I didn’t keep procrastinating watching this movie 4 times for nothing. It took for me to get tipsy to finally watch it. The cinematics was the ONLY positive thing about this movie. The mouth movements of the animals were nowhere near matching what they were saying, which is a major key in my opinion, that counted for about 80% of what made the movie bad to me. The second reason I hated it was because it was too National Geographic looking. It was like watching an entire discovery channel movie in the theater, and that wasn’t a good thing for me because I HATE the discovery channel! They should have left this one alone. I didn’t really like the Alladin movie that much but it was definitely way better than this crap. Lion King my butt, skip this crap and go see Good Boys, the best movie out in theaters right now',\n",

The sound track was great. Only one complaint, which had nothing to do with the movie it was the theater: does the volume on the previews have to be SO LOUD?!?!

But my kids were so bored! It was almost like watching a National Geographic movie. And they made the wrong decision in keeping the eyes COMPLETELY expressionless. It lost all heart. Originally emotional scenes were flat. Timon and Pumbaa redeemed some of the heart (despite Seth Rogen being COMPLETELY tone deaf). I was very disappointed.',\n",

Otherwise it was apparently an attempt to get the worst voice actors for every part (other than Mufasa which was still voiced by James Earl Jones and was as amazing as ever). Otherwise, the voice acting was abysmal. Scar (Chiwetel Ejiofor) was just plain terrible. The voice actor for Timon (Billy Eichner) was apparently required to have the most over the top gay affectation possible (although one of the best singers). And Nala (Beyonce) sounded so ghetto it was distracting. Watch the animated version which is vastly better. Sad since Disney did such a fantastic job with the Aladdin live action remake.',\n",

       "  'review': 'Overall and OK film. Technically well-executed, but creatively uninspired. Pretty much a scene-by-scene replica of the original, which makes it palatable for all ages because the original was good, but also feels uninspired and \"cheap.\" The best I can describe it is like watching a production of a Shakespeare play that you\\'ve read/seen so many times, but this time with different actors, costumes and sets pieces. It\\'s fun to watch just for the nostalgia appeal. The voice acting was well-done all around except for Beyonce who sounded like...well Beyonce reading a script. Parts of the script felt out-dated, out of touch or cheesy, for instance, there was a lot of cringey, campy \"Come-ons!\" and \"Let\\'s do this!\" lines from the child actors. In one scene Beyonce\\'s character literally yells \"Lions, Attack!\"  Meanwhile, they threw in a few twists on certain scenes and transitions but they are so small you might not notice. The most annoying part of the movie was one of these scenes in which they replace the original score with the most random Beyonce song, who was singing as Beyonce and not as her character Nala. It felt so wrong, out of place and obnoxious. All in all worth an end of summer family trip to the movie, but otherwise, you won\\'t miss much by waiting for the DVD/BluRay.',\n",

       "  'review': 'The new Lion King remake is phenomenal!! I personally LOVED the new Lion King. I actually like it just as much as the original if not more. I think Jon Favreau is a creative genius in his visionary take on projects. Unfortunately Disney got the Lion King right the first time, which didn’t necessitate a remake. Which is why 90% of the original had been untouched for the 2019 version. HOWEVER... I think Favreau’s brilliance will really come through if they get him to make a Lion King 2. The original is impossible to beat. But the sequels and spinoffs are much less memorable for MOST fans, yet still provide an excellent foundation for someone like Favreau to take it and really make it something special. Just like he did with Jungle Book. Jungle Book had plenty of room for creative reimagining because it’s not as widely memorable, which is where he could take liberties that he simply didn’t have with Lion King. I honestly think that the remake we got is by far the best possible job any director could’ve done with the scope of the task at hand. Excellent work and it deserves every dollar and accolade that it’s earning as we speak!! TWO THUMBS WAY UP!!!!',\n",

       "  'review': \"The Lion King is a 2019 remake of the 1994 Disney classic The Lion King. The film was directed by Jon Favreau, and stars Donald Glover as Simba and Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar.\\n\\nThe film in my opinion is a disgrace to the original film, from the emotionless character expressions to the dreadful and unfitting voice acting.\\n\\nThe story was basically the same as the original (nearly down to the beat), but for some reason it felt a lot less epic and not nearly as intriguing or emotional.\\n\\nThe voice acting I found to be stale and dry, from the lack of care in the actors voices to the bland and weary line delivery; one voice actor in particular was Shahadi Wright Joseph as (child) Simba, I found that the performance he gave was really lacking in key areas like emotion and timing.\\n\\nThe characters were basically just the same as the original, so I don't really have much to say here.\\n\\nThe animation may be extremely realistic and detailed, but what angers me most is that because of the realism the animals and characters couldn't express as much emotion as they did in the original film.\\n\\nThe colour scheme was also very dark and grey, which in my opinion takes away from the atmosphere and scale of the film.\\n\\nThe soundtrack was also a huge let down from the original film, from Beyoncé and Donald Glover's version of Can You Feel the Love Tonight (which takes place in the day) to the addition of Beyoncé's song Spirit.\\n\\nThe emotion and relationships in the film were also a lot less gripping, especially the relationship between Simba and Mufasa.\\n\\nThe film I also found to be really bland and uninteresting, but what makes it worse is that the original film was really interesting and had a very strong style to it.\\n\\nOver all I give it a \\n1/10 - would never recommend\\n\\nA shallow and heartless product which should have never been made.\",\n",

I think some of the voice acting was off and the casting couldve been a bit better for at least two characters, but thats most likely just my bias towards the original cinematic film. I also realized they did this for the live action purpose, but I disliked the removal of some iconic scenes and actions from specific characters. Some parts from the 1st movie really added depth to characters and helped the audience really laugh or feel the intensity of a characters thoughts, ideas, plans. Again I know they removed a chunk of these things for live action purposes to fit in with realistic actions, but its hard not to mention either. All in all it was a good reminder of how original The Lion King was back in the day and shows us things that couldve been done differently in some aspects.',\n",

A lot of the voice acting felt like I was watching a community theatre play, which is sad because I really like a lot of the voice actors in this movie. While the animation is great and looks realistic, I think it takes away from the performance because the animals aren't allowed to show much emotion. The story in this one felt very rushed and they added some pretty pointless scenes. It feels very lacking and doesn't have near as much heart as the original.\",\n",

There are some things that make the animated film better but you really can't compare an animated film to a CGI one especially CGI done to look real. This is not easy to achieve folks where as animators draw these(CGI) effects take months if not years to create a realistic image\",\n",

The movie felt uninspired and lacked the charm of the original that only animation can provide. The lions were unexpressive and more emphasis was put on making it seem realistic than making a compelling movie. ',\n",

       "  'review': \"My teenage son and I went to see it today and we both thought it was amazing. He wasn't even close to being born when the original came out, but of course he's seen it dozens of times. Now he's a gamer and video maker/editor. He warned me as we were walking in that he might be overly critical but we had both agreed we needed to see it in the theaters before it was gone. Even though we both knew the storyline backwards and forwards we were totally sucked in from beginning to end. There were times that I personally felt anxious, like I didn't know what was going to happen. I'm glad we didn't bring his little sister (7 years-old, but very sensitive) as she would have been scared during several parts. My son and I had both heard not-so-great reviews, so we were on the lookout for negatives but neither of us walked away with any negatives to talk about. The animals and scenery were amazing, the action scenes were engaging, the original humor was there with some added bits. Definitely worth seeing on the big screen.\",\n",

If you got kids you want to introduce Disney films to, the classics are still where to go to.  I will say that this is a better outing than most of what we've gotten so far, mostly because the movie is so alike to the original.  I think the best improvement though is the hyenas are given more of a menacing role than the joke that they were in the original.  On the minus column I think the CGI of the lions faces was subpar, really didn't feel any emotion there.  Zazu as well... hard to watch the way that bird was made, a bit freaky. \",\n",

Also thought Seth Rogen as Pumba was a good call. As it is nearly a shot for shot remake it does end up feeling a bit hollow at times and doesn't pack the punch of the original probably because I've seen it all before and was prepared for the emotional scenes. A good movie but if you've seen the original you can pass on it. \",\n",

       "  'review': 'It was ok, but got quickly bored as it lacked the umph of the original movie, largely owing to the disconnect between the characters and their emotions. With them restricted to hyper realism, there was a distinct lack of emotional connection, so Simba looking terrified, sad or overjoyed all looked the same, and often took me out of the moment. Some of the songs also had to be heavily restrained due to hyper-realistic restrictions, such as Scars \"Be Prepared\" song. There were some alterations from the original which were understandable but kind of took the magic out of the film for me.\\n\\nThe effects were superb but wasn\\'t enough to cover the faults of the film for me.',\n",

Maybe because lions are my favorite big ct, or the music and singing added a dimension that overshadowed that flaw, but I loved the movie. The scenery was lush and beautiful for the most part, I found the main characters heartwarming, and the interplay between Simba and his father both loving and stern when he explained the dangers when he disobeyed him were convincing for me.  Of course the comic moments were truly scene stealing. I washappen to hear James Earl Jones as Mufasah and there were mystic qualities with Rafeki, The death of Mufasah was was much more dramatic and darker than the original which I naturally expected and I will admit it, I cried!!! I really enjoyed it and was happy I didn't listen to critics and saw it for myself! I am glad they just rehash the story, but change little things here and there in the approach to the story line which made it fresh. Definitely a Must See!!!!\",\n",

They manage to get the lions and hyenas to show a lot more than others.\\nShouldn't really need to talk about the story not much change in it \\nI would say this movie wasn't the greatest but there wasn't anything bad in it it was a lot more in the middle for me. It isn't a second watch  for me anytime soon but enjoyable I would say  \\n\",\n",

       "  'review': 'Overall it\\'s a good film, but there\\'s certainly an uncanny valley feeling compared to the original animation which just sucks you in.  The cinematography is beautiful, the graphics are life-like, but some of the voice acting felt weak.  Donald Glover was great, James Earl Jones is great as we can expect, but I felt Ejiofor, while an incredible actor I\\'ve loved in other flicks, didn\\'t have the level of menace Scar held in the original.  This being said, I think the change to Be Prepared, being made like a pre-battle speech for war was genius and Ejiofor NAILS that particular part.  The additional characters for Simba\\'s time growing up with Timon and Pumba felt unnecessary, and some of the changes to Rafiki\\'s part before Simba sees \"who he is\" felt less engaging than the animated original - but honestly all of this is nit-picking.  I enjoy the film and it felt worth the price of admission.',\n",

I'm not sure whether it was just me, but i felt that some of the voice acting was a little stale, having little emotion behind its performance.  Additionally the CGI made for fantastic models of animals but failed in giving them facial expressions.  This seemed to make the events of the film (which we're all familiar with) feel like they had less of an impact on the characters.  Overall it was still true to the lion king original in its writing and direction, but felt a little uninspired.  Having said that i'm aware that I am probably in the minority as many friends and a family enjoyed it very much.\",\n",
